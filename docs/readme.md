# üí° SimpleComponents Documentation

Welcome to the SimpleComponents library! This library was developed to provide simple and easy-to-use interfaces for controlling an LED and reading the value of a potentiometer using an Arduino. With this library, you can easily set up and control these components without having to write the boilerplate code yourself.

## üìö Reference

For detailed information on the classes and methods provided by the library, see the [Reference Documentation](https://github.com/ArchontisKostis/SimpleComponents/blob/main/docs/Reference.md). The reference includes descriptions of each class and method, as well as example usage snippets to help you get started.

## üöÄ Examples

To see more concrete examples of how to use the library in an Arduino sketch, check out the [Library's Examples Folder](https://github.com/ArchontisKostis/SimpleComponents/tree/main/examples) or the [Documentation Examples](https://archontiskostis.github.io/SimpleComponents/docs/examples/). There, you'll find a collection of sketches that demonstrate different features of the library. You can use these sketches as a starting point for your own projects, or just to see how the library works.
