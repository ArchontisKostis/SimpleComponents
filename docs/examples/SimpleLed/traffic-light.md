# üö¶ Traffic Light

This example demonstrates how to use the `SimpleLed` class to create a traffic light with three LEDs. The traffic light sequence is:

- Red for 5 seconds
- Yellow for 1 second
- Green for 5 seconds

To use this example, you will need to connect three LEDs to digital pins 9, 10, and 11 on your Arduino board. You may also want to use 220Œ© resistors to limit the current going through the LEDs.

## üîß Hardware Components

- Arduino board
- 3x LEDs
- 3x 220Œ© resistors (optional)

## üíª Code

```cpp
// Include the SimpleComponents Library
#include <SimpleComponents.h>    

// You could also only import SimpleLed
// #include <SimpleLed.h> 

// Create three SimpleLed objects for the traffic light
SimpleLed red(9);
SimpleLed yellow(10);
SimpleLed green(11);

void setup() {
  // Initialize the LEDs
  red.init();
  yellow.init();
  green.init();
}

void loop() {
  // Turn on the red LED
  red.on();
  delay(5000);

  // Turn on the yellow LED
  yellow.on();
  delay(1000);
  yellow.off();

  // Turn on the green LED
  green.on();
  delay(5000);

  // Turn off all the LEDs
  red.off();
  green.off();
  yellow.off();
}
```
